teaser: Of laziness, procrastination, and perfectionism. But mostly laziness.

It took me about ten years to design, build, and finally publish this website. The actual work happened over the past two months; the previous one hundred and eighteen were mostly a mix of procrastination, laziness, second-guessing, and indecisiveness.

The turning point was setting a hard deadline. One weekend in February, I sat down in front of the computer and decided that no matter what, by Sunday night, my website would be up and running.

And just like that, three months later, it was.

Well, unless we count the extra days it took me to write, rewrite, shorten, and re-rewrite this blog post. Days that were also delayed by pondering whether the "Work" section should be called "Projects" instead, or something else entirely. Not to mention the time spent researching what to write in the footer.

And maybe, just maybe, I should wait a bit longer to work on accessibility, fix the mobile layout, adjust the colors, improve the typography, put my email address somewhere, add a light/dark mode switch, a favicon, an RSS feed...

Or I could just call it a work in progress and be done with it.
