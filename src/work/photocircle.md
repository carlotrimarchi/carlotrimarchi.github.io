description: "<p>Photocircle is a Berlin-based art platform that sells photographs and artwork to fund social projects. While it originally supported initiatives around the world, since 2021 it has focused on planting trees for each artwork sold.</p> <p>From a technical perspective, it's a large-scale e-commerce platform that we built from scratch. It's a project especially close to my heart, as I’ve been part of the team since its inception and have worked on it for over ten years. I’ve contributed to several redesigns of the website and led the implementation of its mobile version.</p> <p>More broadly, working on Photocircle has given me the opportunity to design and implement a wide range of features: integrating payment systems and multiple payment APIs, automating workflows with third-party services like shops and photo producers, and navigating the ongoing challenges of maintaining a large and complex production system. Overall, the project has played a big role in my growth as a developer.</p>"
