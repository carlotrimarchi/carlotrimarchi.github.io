description: <p>ERCcOMICS was an EU-funded science communication initiative supported by the European Research Council (ERC). Its goal was to make complex research projects engaging, fun, and accessible to a wider audience through experimental, interactive, and immersive webcomics.</p> <p>The project ran for four years, and as the sole developer, I was responsible for creating the entire publishing platform. I collaborated closely with a remote, international team of researchers, artists, and project coordinators to implement the interactions and animations that brought each story to life on the web.</p>
