description: <p>The Digital Career Institute (DCI) is a school in Germany that offers bootcamps for adults and career changers looking to enter the tech industry. I worked there for four years, both as a freelancer and later as a full-time employee, teaching seven remote cohorts of learners starting their journey into web development.</p> <p>As a teacher, I focused on empathy, clarity, and inclusivity, aiming to create a supportive learning environment where students with little or no prior experience could build confidence and a strong foundation in programming.</p> <p>In my final two years at DCI, I also took on the role of curriculum coordinator. I rewrote the entire JavaScript curriculum from scratch, creating a whole new set of exercises and significantly improving the accompanying teaching materials.</p>
