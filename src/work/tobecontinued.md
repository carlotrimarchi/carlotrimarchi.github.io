description: <p>To Be Continued is a highly experimental and interactive webcomic about a group of teenagers who, among other things, happen to have superpowers.</p> <p>What makes it stand out, especially for when it was first conceived and built, is that it tells a long-form story across three seasons and over 100 chapters, with each chapter designed differently. Every chapter explores a unique way of presenting and navigating the story, inviting the reader to engage with it in a new way each time. It’s the project that started my career as a webcomic developer and pushed me to explore more creative possibilities on the web. It remains one of the most ambitious and personal projects I’ve worked on. It remains one of the most ambitious and personal projects I’ve worked on.</p><p>To this day, I still brag about the mention it got in a <a href="https://www.scottmccloud.com/2014/12/19/every-which-way/">post on Scott McCloud’s blog</a> — mostly to the two or three friends who actually know who he is.</p>
