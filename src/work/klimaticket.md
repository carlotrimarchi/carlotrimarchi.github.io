description: Klimaticket is a project that encourages air travelers to take responsibility for the environmental impact of flying. I developed a widget that calculates a voluntary climate contribution based on flight distance, allowing users to estimate their emissions and donate accordingly. The contributions go toward supporting the construction of a solar power plant in Switzerland.
